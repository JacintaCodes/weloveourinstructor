# We Love Our Instructor

## About

Today is the last day of class and we could not find a way to thank our instructor enough for how much he has impacted our lives, so we built an application to express our gratitude. Many of us went from no coding skills to being software engineers. We would like our instructor to know that we are eternally grateful for giving us the guidance and inspiration to succeed as newly-knighted POC in the tech industry.
